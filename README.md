# Enhancing face images from surveillance cameras using generative adversarial networks
The aim of this project is to implement relatively new algorithm in machine learning based on the principles of artificial neural networks and apply it on low-quality face images shot on surveillance cameras. The ultimate goal is that, from an image with exceedingly low resolution and a high level of blurriness, we get an image that meets today’s standards, that is, enriched with finer details and textures, and with decent resolution.  The objectives of this project are following:

•	Create a generative adversarial network that will be able to perform super-resolution.

•	From an image with exceedingly low resolution and a high level of blurriness to generate an image enriched with finer details and textures, and with decent resolution.

•	Find weaknesses for further improvement of the algorithm.

•	Test the model on real surveillance camera images to demonstrate its practical application.
